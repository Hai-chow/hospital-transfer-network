  "description": "The three datasets (i.e., Transfer-Encounters, Transfer-Outcomes, Transfer-Locations) provide the number of hospital transfers and Major Diagnostic Categories (MDCs). The Transfer-Encounters Dataset provides transfer counts by patient characteristics (i.e., Race/Ethnicity, Language Group, Expected Payer, Age Group and Assigned Sex at Birth) for each MDC. The Transfer-Outcomes shows the transfer outcomes (i.e., Median Length of Stay, Percent of Leaving Against Medical Advice and Percent of Inpatient Death) by MDC. The Transfer-Location dataset shows the locations of Acute Care Hospitals which received at least 25 transfers by MDC.",
